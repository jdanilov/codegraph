# Visualizer — design contract (ROADMAP item 2)

Local web UI that renders a codegraph project as an explorable graph. CodeGraph
surfaces intra-code relations to agents; the visualizer surfaces the same
relations to developers — navigating agent-generated code, reviewing changes,
and producing feedback an agent can act on.

This document is the CONTRACT for the implementation agent train. Later phases
build against the API and layout rules fixed here; do not change a contract
item without updating this file in the same commit.

## Locked decisions

| Area | Decision |
|---|---|
| Serve | `codegraph ui [--port] [--path <root>]` subcommand in this package; binds **127.0.0.1 only**; no auth |
| Server stack | `node:http` + hand-rolled router — **zero new runtime dependencies** |
| DB access | Server owns one `CodeGraph` instance (writer); auto-starts `watch()` so the graph stays live; frontend **polls** `/api/status` and refetches on version change |
| Indexing | The UI MAY trigger `codegraph index` (`POST /api/index`, spawned as a subprocess); un-indexed root shows an "index now" screen |
| Frontend | Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind + shadcn/ui, `web/` directory, single root `package.json` (frontend deps in devDependencies, **no npm workspaces**) |
| Graph rendering | **sigma.js (WebGL)**; budget ≤2k simultaneously visible nodes |
| Build | `npm run build` also builds `web/` → `dist/ui-web/`, served statically; git-URL installs build it via the existing `prepare` hook |
| Question box | Floor: raw text → explore (deterministic, always works). Optional: LLM refine (Anthropic API, key entered in UI settings) |
| Persistence | Cards + UI state: `.codegraph/ui/` in the project (gitignored). User prefs (editor command, API key): `~/.codegraph/ui.json` |
| Editor jump | Command template from `~/.codegraph/ui.json` (e.g. `cursor -g {file}:{line}`), run server-side; client-side `vscode://` URL-scheme fallback when unset |
| Design | Minimal + light futuristic; graph is the background; code panels / views float on top |
| Out of scope v1 | Commit-history / time animation (no gource time axis), auth, UI test coverage, mobile |

## Visual language (locked)

- **Backbone = `contains`, drawn as structure, never as an edge list.** Each
  directory/file/symbol is a circle. A collapsed parent shows its children as
  small satellites hugging it (atom/nucleus). Shift+click expands: the child
  moves away along a **straight** line; shift+click again collapses.
- **Non-contains edges are slightly curved lines**; backbone lines are straight.
- **Provenance renders**: parsed edges solid, `provenance:'heuristic'` edges
  **dashed**, tooltip shows `metadata.synthesizedBy` + the wiring site.
- **Edge-kind toggles**: calls / imports / references / extends / instantiates
  (contains is never toggleable — it IS the backbone).
- **Node encoding**: color = switchable mode (① node kind ② layer — derived
  from filename layer suffixes, read from the project's `plugins.layer-chain`
  config when present, else hidden); size = LoC for files/dirs (aggregate),
  span length for symbols; border style reserved.
- **Layout**: radial from the project root, growing **left-to-right in a ~120°
  wedge**. Expanded children are force-laid on the RIGHT of the parent, never
  the left, pre-ordered vertically by name (A top → Z bottom). Dragging pins a
  node; a quick wobble drag unpins it.
- **Hover** shows a node's edges; **click** opens the info panel.
- **Auto-expansion for a card/view**: expand every ancestor of the result
  nodes; leave siblings collapsed.
- **URL = state**: expanded set + active card encoded in the URL.

## HTTP API (contract)

All JSON under `/api/`; everything else serves `dist/ui-web/` static files
(SPA fallback to `index.html`). Path params validated inside the project root
(reuse the existing path-refusal helpers).

| Endpoint | Contract |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/status` | `{ indexed, root, dataVersion, fileCount, nodeCount, watching }` — `dataVersion` changes whenever the DB changes (drives polling + ETag) |
| `GET /api/graph` | Full graph, ETagged by `dataVersion`. `{ nodes: [{ id, kind, name, qualifiedName, file, startLine, endLine, parent, layer? }], edges: [{ source, target, kind, provenance?, synthesizedBy?, line? }], dirs: [{ path, parent, fileCount, loc }] }`. `contains` is expressed via `parent`, NOT in `edges`. |
| `GET /api/node/:id` | Info panel payload: node fields + contained nodes + in/out edges (with target names/kinds) + source (see `/api/source`) |
| `GET /api/source?file&start&end&mode=full\|diff` | Source text of a span; `diff` mode returns only hunks vs `HEAD` overlapping the span |
| `GET /api/search?q` | Fuzzy/FTS over nodes for Cmd+P: `[{ id, name, qualifiedName, kind, file }]`, ranked, ≤50 |
| `POST /api/explore` | `{ query }` → explore result as **structured** nodes/edges/flow (`{ nodeIds, edgeRefs, flow: [{ from, to, via }], summary }`), reusing the MCP explore implementation (refactor to expose a structured result; the MCP markdown path must not regress) |
| `POST /api/ask` | `{ question }` → LLM (key from settings) turns the question into a symbol bag → `/api/explore` internally. `501` when no key configured |
| `GET/PUT /api/cards` | CRUD on `.codegraph/ui/cards.json`: `[{ id, question, createdAt, result }]` |
| `GET /api/changes` | `{ changedNodes: [{ id, status: added\|modified\|deleted }], impactedNodeIds, hunks }` — git diff vs HEAD mapped onto node spans, plus impact radius via `getImpactRadius` |
| `POST /api/index` | Spawn `codegraph index` for the root; streams progress (chunked) |
| `POST /api/open` | `{ file, line }` → run the configured editor command template; `409` when unset (client then uses `vscode://`) |
| `GET/PUT /api/settings` | `~/.codegraph/ui.json`: `{ editorCommand?, anthropicApiKey?, model? }`. The key is never echoed back in full (masked) |

### Phase A clarifications (additive — no contract item changed)

The server implemented in phase A fixes a few details the table above left
open. Later phases and the client can rely on them:

- **Directory identity.** `dirs[]` entries carry an `id` of `dir:<path>`
  alongside `path`; the project root is `path: ""` / `id: "dir:"` with
  `parent: null`. A file node's `parent` is its directory's id, so the
  backbone is one connected tree from the root down to symbols. A symbol whose
  `contains` parent is missing falls back to its file node.
- **Extra response fields.** `/api/status` also returns `projectName`,
  `edgeCount`, `indexing` and `watcherDegraded`; `/api/graph` also returns
  `indexed`, `dataVersion`, `root`, `projectName` and the `layers` vocabulary.
- **Errors** are `{ error: { code, message } }`. A 501 stub carries that error
  **plus** the contract's empty result shape, so a client can read it without
  special-casing. `GET /api/graph` is `ETag: W/"v<dataVersion>"`.
- **`POST /api/index`** streams newline-delimited JSON events
  (`start` / `log` / `done` / `error`), releasing the database to the spawned
  CLI for the duration of the run.
- **Hardening**: loopback `Host` headers only (DNS-rebinding), every served
  path through `validatePathWithinRoot`, and the editor command is tokenized
  and spawned without a shell.

Standing views (always-present cards, client-side): **Project** (whole graph)
and **Changes** (`/api/changes`, refreshed on `dataVersion` change).

**Feedback export**: from a card + selected nodes, generate markdown (file
paths, line spans, user note) to paste into an agent prompt. Client-side only.

## Phases (agent train, sequential)

1. **A — server + scaffold**: `codegraph ui` command, `src/ui-server/`, all
   endpoints except `explore/ask/changes` (stub those with typed 501s),
   watcher auto-start, `web/` scaffold rendering a proof-of-life (node count
   from `/api/graph`), full build wiring.
2. **B — canvas**: sigma.js backbone, atom/expand/collapse, wedge force
   layout, pin/unpin, hover edges, curved-vs-straight + solid-vs-dashed,
   color modes, edge-kind toggles.
3. **C — panels**: node info panel, source full/diff, editor jump, Cmd+P
   fuzzy search, settings UI.
4. **D — questions + changes**: cards, explore/ask endpoints (structured
   explore refactor), Changes view with badges + impact radius,
   auto-expansion, feedback export, URL state.

## House rules for every phase

- The customer/validation project's name must NEVER appear anywhere in this
  repo (code, comments, fixtures, docs). Use generic examples.
- No new runtime dependencies for the server. Frontend deps are devDependencies.
- Do not regress the MCP server, CLI, or index pipeline; `npm test` stays green.
- No UI test coverage required for v1 (explicit scope decision).
- CHANGELOG entry per phase under `[Unreleased]`, user-facing wording.
